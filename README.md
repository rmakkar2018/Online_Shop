Stakeholders:
  1) Customer
  2) Employee
  3) Supplier
  4) Owner
  
For Customer:
  This is an Online store which can be used by the customer to order items online. Now no need to stand in big billing queues. 
  Search the item in SEARCH.
    Here for searching the item we have provided him query assistance to the user
  Order the items online. 
  Make the payment, and collect the items within 24 hours from store.
  He can his previous orders and items( Tried to use indexing here)
  
It also helps in managing the employees, supplier to the Manager and the owner

For Employee:
  It will keep a track of their attendance, they can view there profile, customer query.
  They can view only there profile to maintain data security
  
For Supplier:
  We can keep a track of the items supplied by any registered supplier.

For Manager:
  He can check the attendance of the employee.
  View profile of all the employees under him (only) to maintain data security
  He can check the overall sales
  
 For Owner:
  He can register a manager
  Can view any profile of any employee, supplier, manager
  Can check the sales 
  Will get the predicted sale over a period of month for upcoming month to order the products accordingly to prevent loss due excess items
  
We have also implemented a Sign in and Login system for the customer, employee, supplier, manager and the owner.
  It will have a default 1001 id reserved for the Owner of the company ( as is the only one with many admin previliges )
  After that the owner will register any manager and a manager will register any employee.
  A supplier and a customer can register themselves anytime from the register screen.
 
 Just give it Try...............
